## Motivation

I don't think you can stress people out to create focus. Techniques such as chunking time into intervals break up the flow too much. That's how I realized the Time itself was a distraction.

We're not productive because we always think there is something going on outside. No news, no time, no outside world.

This app turns the digital clock into an analog clock using a hotkey. The day, date, and precise time are still there waiting for you.
